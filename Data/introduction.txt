The folder called training_data contains 200k EM traces captured from 5 Bluetooth-supported nRF52 devices. Each trace is captured by coaxial cable from the profiling device and each trace is the average of 100 traces of the same encryption. 

The folder called testing_data contains 25k EM traces captured from another 5 Bluetooth-supported nRF52 devices. Each trace is captured at 15 meters distance to the victim device. For each device, we further have 1, 10 and 100_avg section which are for the case that a testing trace is the average of 1, 10 and 100 traces of the same encryption.
